This datapack improves and optimizes the performance of the Minecraft world to ensure a good gaming experience.
To achieve this, this datapack uses over 6 efficient methods, more than similar datapacks that use only a few methods.
These methods can be easily configured through the in-game GUI, which provides additional information and special actions.
The datapack has been designed with performance in mind, so that it has almost no impact on the game performance itself.

## üìñ Features

- 7 different lag reduction methods that actually work
- does not affect important entities
- simple in-game GUI with lots of settings
- additional information about the world
- does not create lag itself

By default, all farm animals, bosses, decorative entities, pets, nearby entities and entities with names are not deleted. However, they will be frozen if they are too far away from the player, unless they are an end boss or have the name **ignore**.
Additionally, all entities that are within 64 blocks of an armor stand named **ignore** will not be frozen.

All settings and actions can be done through the in-game GUI. To open it, simply type the command `/function #nola:menu` in the chat (only works with command permissions).

## üìù Methods to reduce lag

- entities that are too far away from a player are frozen
- in certain intervals all unimportant entities are deleted
- multiple Xp Orbs are combined
- collision of farm animals are deactivated
- items despawn earlier
- less entities can stand together on one block
- if too many entities of the same type are too close to each other, all other entities of the species will be deleted

## Limitations

The **ONLY** purpose of the datapack is to improve the [TPS](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick), **NOT** the [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate). There may be an FPS improvement in single player mode, but this is more because the computer has to spend less time on other calculations. If you are looking for real FPS improvement, I would recommend [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)/[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium).
If your server has performance problems, I would also advise you to try [PaperSpigot](https://papermc.io/) or [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)/[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) first, as these are much more powerful than this datapack.

## Notes

- **ONLY** the latest version of the datapack for Fabric and Vanilla 1.20 is supported
- bug reports and suggestions are **ONLY** accepted on [GitHub](https://github.com/2mal3/No-Lag/issues)
- datapack was created with [mc-build](https://github.com/mc-build/mc-build).
- should not create any lag by itself
