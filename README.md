# No-Lag-Datapack
![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/2mal3/No-Lag-Datapack?style=flat-square) ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft-1.19-orange?style=flat-square) ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/2mal3/No-Lag-Datapack/total?style=flat-square)

This datapack improves and optimizes the performance of the minecraft world to ensure a good gaming experience.
To achieve this, this datapack uses over 6 efficient methods, more than similar datapacks that use only a few methods.
These methods can be easily configured via the in game GUI, which provides additional information and special actions.
Thereby, the datapack was designed with performance in mind, so that it has almost no effect on the game performance itself.

## üìñ Features:
- Over 6 different methods to reduce lag that actually work
- Simple in-game gui with many settings
- Does not affect important entities
- Additional information about the world
- Does not create lag itself

By default, all farm animals, bosses, decorative entities, pets, near entities and entities with names are not deleted. However, all are frozen if they are too far away from a player, except if they are an end boss or have the name **ignore**.
Additionally, all entities that are within 64 blocks of an armor stand named **ignore** will not be frozen.

All settings and actions can be done via the in game GUI. To open it, you just have to type command `/function #nola:menu` into the chat (only works with command permissions).

## üìù Methods to reduce lag:
- Entities that are too far away from a player are frozen
- In certain intervals all unimportant entities are deleted
- Multiple Xp Orbs are combined
- Collision of farm animals are deactivated
- Items despawn earlier
- Les entities can stand together on one block
- If too many entities of the same type are too close to each other, all other entities of the species will be deleted.

## Limitations:
The **ONLY** purpose of the datapack is to improve the [TPS](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tick), **NOT** the [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate). There may be an FPS improvement in single player mode, but this is more because the computer has to spend less time on other calculations. If you are looking for real FPS improvement, I would recommend [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)/[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) with  [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium).
If your server has performance problems, I would also advise you to try [PaperSpigot](https://papermc.io/) or [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)/[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) first, as these are much more powerful than this datapack.

## Notes:
- Tested for Fabric and Vanilla in 1.19
- Not tested with Forge, Bukkti, Spigot and PaperSpigot but probably don't work
- To uninstall, simply click in the datapack menu on **Uninstall this datapack** and then remove the datapack from the worlds folder
- The datapack was created with [mc-build](https://github.com/mc-build/mc-build).
- The datapack should not create any lag by itself
