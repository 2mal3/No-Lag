This datapack improves and optimizes the performance of the minecraft world to ensure a good gaming experience.             
To achieve this, this datapack uses over 6 efficient methods, more than similar datapacks that use only a few methods.       
These methods can be easily configured via the in game GUI, which provides additional information and special actions.                          
Thereby the datapack was designed with performance in mind, so that it has almost no effect on the game performance itself.             

## üìñ Features:
- Over 6 different methods to reduce lag
- Simple in-game gui with many settings
- Does not affect important entities
- Is actively developed
- Additional information about the world
- Does not create lag itself

By default, all farm animals, bosses, decorative entities, pets, near entities and entities with names are not deleted. However, all are frozen if they are too far away from a player, except if they are an end boss or have the name **ignore**.
Additionally, all entities that are within 64 blocks of an armor stand named **ignore** will not be frozen.                       

All settings and actions can be done via the in game gui. To open it you just have to type command `function #2mal3:nola/menu` into the chat (only works with command permissions).

## üìù Methods to reduce lag:
- Entities that are too far away from a player are frozen
- In certain intervals all unimportant entities are deleted
- Multiple Xp Orbs are combined
- Collision of farm animals are deactivated
- Items despawn earlier
- Les entities can stand together on one block
- If too many entities of the same type are too close to each other, all other entities of the species will be deleted.

## Limitations:
This datapack reduces the lag percentage. This means that it is most effective when you already have heavy lag. If there are only few lag, the datapack is less useful and you should consider if you need it at all.                                                       
In general this datapack is only suitable for survival worlds and only improves the performance of world / server. It does not improve the performance of mods, shaders, datapacks and FPS.                                                                                 
It is tried to make this datapack compatible with other datapacks, but it cannot be guaranteed that problems can occur in combination with other datapacks.

## üìä Bug reports:
If you find a bug in the datapack, it would be very helpful to report it to me.                                                          
You can do this either on the [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/no-lag-datapack/) website as a comment or on the [GitHub](https://github.com/2mal3/No-Lag-Datapack) website as an issue.                                        
To help me better, it would also be handy if you debug the datapack. You can do this by simply clicking on Debug datapack in the datapack menu and write the displayed message into the bug report.

## üöÄ Performance:
The datapack should not cause lags under any conditions. Due to the strong anti lag methods in the datapack the opposite is the case.

## ‚úÖ Compatibility with other datapacks:
During the development of the datapack, great care is taken to make it as compatible as possible with other datapacks.                        
Unfortunately, due to the anti lag methods used, it is not possible to make the datapack completely compatible with all others. However, there should be almost no problems with datapack that follow the [datapack conventions](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/).

The datapack is under continuous development, but it takes time before a new version is released.
