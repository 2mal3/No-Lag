# No-Lag-Datapack v.1.7.6

The No Lag Datapack v.1.7.6 is designed to reduce the lag in the world. This is done with 7 different, efficient and adjustable methods (other similar datapacks use only 1-2 methods). Furthermore the whole datapack has been programmed to use very little resources itself.

With a few of these methods, this datapack can render some farms and other datapacks unusable. For a lower risk and lag reduction you can use my No Lag Light Datapack.

Methods (Most of them can be changed under data > nld > functions > config.mcfunction):
 - Multiple xp orbs are combined into a single xp orb.
 - If a specified number of tnt is exceeded, all tnts are removed.
 - Items despawn earlier.
 - The collision of farm animals is switched off.
 - Only a specific number of entitys can be on one block.
 - Above a certain number of entitys in the world, certain actions are performed.
 - Entitys that are far away from the player are deactivated.

 To uninstall, enter /function #nld:uninstall and drag the Datapack folder from the Datapacks Order of the World.
